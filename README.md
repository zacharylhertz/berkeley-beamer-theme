# UC Berkeley Beamer Template for R Markdown
I've sent around a basic Beamer template to some other PhD students, and also have shared a Berkeley theme I modified slightly from Overleaf, so I figured I'd combine the two into a public repository in case it is helpful to others.

# Instructions
Look at the .rmd file for basic implementation. Note that figures and tables will usually require rescaling, which can be done in the usual way for R Markdown. The .sty file can be modified for users who aim to port the theme to match other institutions' palettes and styles.

# Acknowledgements
The .sty file is a tweak I made from the [UC Berkeley Beamer Theme on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/uc-berkeley-beamer-theme/bywswngntrws) created by LianTze Lim and Ryan Looney, who remain credited in the .sty file. I also created figures in this document using the public [American Local Government Elections Database](https://osf.io/mv5e6/files/osfstorage) created by Justin de Benedictis-Kessner, Diana Da In Lee, Yamil Velez, and Christopher Warshaw.
